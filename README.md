# 🎧 Digital Signal Processing (Hands-On Project)

This project is a **hands-on learning experience** I worked on while studying Digital Signal Processing. It includes a wide range of basic and advanced DSP operations, all wrapped in a simple and interactive **Python Tkinter GUI**.

The goal was to understand and implement common signal processing techniques from scratch, visualize their effects, and make learning DSP more interactive.

🗂️ **Input and Output Format**:  
Signals are **read from `.txt` files**, and the processed results are **displayed in the GUI** and also **saved in the `saved_output` folder as `.txt` files** for easy inspection and reuse.

## 🛠️ What’s Included?

The app supports the following signal processing features:

### ✅ Frequency Domain
- **DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)**
- **IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform)**
- **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**

### ✅ Time Domain
- **Remove DC Component**
- **Smoothing (Low-pass filtering)**
- **Sharpening (High-pass filtering)**
- **Folding (Time reversal)**
- **Delaying & Advancing**
- **Convolution with custom filters**
- **Resampling** – change the sampling rate of the signal
- **Apply Filters** (Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass, Band-stop)

Each operation can be applied through a user-friendly GUI, with immediate visual feedback to help understand the effects of each transformation.
